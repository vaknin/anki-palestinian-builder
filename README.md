# Learn Levantine Arabic

A daily Arabic vocabulary builder that helps you learn naturally through spaced repetition.

## What it does

This tool automatically adds new Levantine Arabic words to your Anki flashcard deck every day. Each word includes:

- **English translation** - what the word means
- **Arabic script** - how it's written
- **Pronunciation guide** - how to say it (romanized)
- **Audio** - native pronunciation to help you speak correctly

You'll get 10 new words daily, presented as flashcards from both directions (English→Arabic and Arabic→English) so you can practice recognition and recall.

## The learning approach

Instead of cramming hundreds of words at once, you learn steadily - 10 words per day. Anki's spaced repetition algorithm shows you each word at the perfect moment before you forget it, making vocabulary stick naturally.

The tool automatically:
- Randomly selects words you haven't learned yet
- Creates beautiful flashcards with audio
- Tracks your progress
- Syncs with your Anki app

## What you'll learn

The vocabulary covers everyday Levantine Arabic - the dialect spoken in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine. From basic words like "a lot" (كْتير / kteer) to practical terms for daily conversation.
